# Koncert

 uniting fans and artists...

It is a smart ticketing platform based on NFTs to connect musical artists and their fans and prevent fraud concert ticket sales.

## Objectives

- Allow artists to mint and sell NFTs for the concert tickets which contain the seat number. Fans can directly buy and lock their NFT tickets without the need of trust of any third party.
- NFTs will also act as unique and genuinely valuable assets even after the concert is over. The value of NFT will depend on the popularity of the artist. Fans can resale the NFTs after the concert and a part of it would go to the original creator.
- We can expand the platform by allowing artists to sell unreleased parts of song, rare clips from recording sessions and also fan meeting tickets.
